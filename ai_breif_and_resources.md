AI is the abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is a Field of Study of Research that studies how to realize the intelligent human behaviors on a computer.

It can also be thought of as the intelligence, which is demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals.

The ultimate goal of AI is to make a computer that can learn, plan, and solve problems autonomously. So in lamen language it can be said that it is the intelligence of a machine. <br>
Take this in a contrast that as humans are provided with brain to solve problems, machines are given an artificial intelligence, that can help them take decisions and provide solutions to complex problems.
