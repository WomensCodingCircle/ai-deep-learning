### II. Tutorials  


### III. Books

#### III-a. Books for Beginners 

 * Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, James et al.  
   Stanford professors, MOOC and video available from Lagunitas.  
   Good beginner book on machine learning concepts. Has easy practice questions.  
   Don't need to know R.  Many Python versions of code is available from others.  

#### III-b. Books for Intermediate ML and DL

 * Python Data Science Handbook, Jake VanderPlas  
   Teaches you how to ise main machine learning Python libraties. Not a core concepts book.  
   Covers Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and a little bit of Unix bash commands.  
     - github:  https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook  
   
 * Hands on Machine Learning, 2nd ed, Aurélien Géron   
     - Early Release pdf:  https://www.knowledgeisle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-Aur%C3%A9lien-G%C3%A9ron-Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-Tensorflow_-Concepts-Tools-and-Techniques-to-Build-Intelligent-Systems-O%E2%80%99Reilly-Media-2019.pdf    
     - github:  https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2   

#### III-c. Books for Foundations

 * Goodfellow et al., Deep Learning   
     - link to pdf:  https://www.deeplearningbook.org/front_matter.pdf   
     - link to website:  https://www.deeplearningbook.org/  

#### III-d. Related Books in Statistics & Probability, Algorithms, and Python Programming

 * Alorithms Illuminated, 1, 2, 3, 4, by Tim Roughgarden 
   Stanford professor, teaches MOOC on Lagunitas since 2012, video and forum available to all.  

 * Statistical Rethinking  
   Bayesian statistics.  

### IV. Conferences and Events  

 * SciPy Conferenc, annual in July  
 * PyData Conference, several times a year in different locations. 
 * PyCon Conference, annual in June  
 * Meetups - get moral support from other learners and build your network.  
 * Kaggle Competitions: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions   
     - Best for building experience with professional-level deep learning projects.  

### V. Tools, Environments

 * B. Amazon AWS - about 90 cents/hr for GPU xlarge, free non-GPU available

 * C. Binder - free, limit 200 concurrent users, slow with many users.  

#### VI. Miscellaneous

 * xkcd comics on programming  
 * reddit - programming thread  
 * HackerRank - simple coding practice, many languages
 * CodeWars - simple coding practice, many languages  
 * StackOverflow - answering newbie questions is very good for firming up one's own learning.  It's also a good practice for debugging and reading other people's code.   
 * Cracking the Coding Interview book - uses Java.  
   Worked Python solutions available from others. 
 * Algoexpert.com - about $80-100 for 1 year, look for sales.
