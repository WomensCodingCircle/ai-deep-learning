### Top-5 books:   
By Jennifer E. Yoon, Github user: JennEYoon, \#hactoberfest-2021    
  
 1. Howard and Gugger, ***Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch***, c 2020  
   After working through VanderPlas, fastai has the best beginner book for deep learning.
     - Amazon book:  https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=fastai&qid=1603575065&sr=8-1

     - fastai v2 library github: https://github.com/fastai/fastai 
     - Fast.ai website:  https://www.fast.ai/  
     - Colab notebooks:  https://course.fast.ai/start_colab    
     - Youtube playlist for 2020 version, Part-1 Practical Code:

       https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSWRCYUHh-ThVCC39bp5yiq  
       
 2. **New** -- Magnus Ekman, NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, Learning Deep Learning, c 2022 NVIDIA Corporation, Addison-Wesley publisher.  
     - Has 666 pages of very thorough instructions and very clear color graphics that lays out the current state of deep learning using TensorFlow. The exhibits and cheatsheets at the end are exceptionally good and is worth the price of the book by itself. I would not call it a beginner's book. But if you are somewhat comfortable with calculus and linear algebra and have 1 year of daily programming experience, then it would be suitable even as your first book on deep learning.   

 3. VanderPlas, ***Python Data Science Handbook***, c 2017     
   Best book for learning Python data science libraries, i.e. NumPy, MatplotLib, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter/iPython.  
    - Link: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/        
       
 4. Goodfellow et al., ***Deep Learning Book***   
   Has more math and theory. Is a definitive reference.     
     - Link: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/  
     - free book:  <a href="./books/Goodfellow-Deep-Learning.pdf" alt="Goodfellow">
     > <img src="./books/goodfellow.jpg" width="150"></a>

 5. James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, ***An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R***, c 2013.   
   8th printing with corrections, c 2017.  
   Very good place to start for a beginner to machine learning. Python codes available by others on Github.   
     - main website:  http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/  
     - free book:  http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf   
     - class:  https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about   
  
 * See also **3 Blue and 1 Brown** YouTube playlist on ***Neural Networks***.   
   This guy has very good visual summaries of complex math problems.  
   The Neural Networks playlist is a very good summary of visual deep learning.
